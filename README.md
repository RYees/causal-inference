## Overview of Business need
A common frustration in the industry, especially when it comes to getting business insights from tabular data, is that the most interesting questions (from their perspective) are often not answerable with observational data alone. These questions can be similar to:
“What will happen if I halve the price of my product?”
“Which clients will pay their debts only if I call them?”

Judea Pearl and his research group have developed in the last decades a solid theoretical framework to deal with that, but the first steps toward merging it with mainstream machine learning are just beginning. 

## Introduction
As indicated in the overview this project The main objective of the task is to highlight the importance of the matter in a concrete way. In this spirit, the following tasks will be done:
* Perform a causal inference task using Pearl’s framework;
* Infer the causal graph from observational data and then validate the graph;
* Merge machine learning with causal inference;


## Workflow
Steps done to do the project:
* Data Exploration. 
   * perfoming EDA
   * feature extraction and scaling
* Causal Learning
   * Spliting data into training and hold-out set 
   * Creating causal graph
   * Training a model
